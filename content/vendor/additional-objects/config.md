When a config spec is included an application, the Admin Console will show a [settings page](/vendor/config/config-screen/) to allow the end user to input data that will be used to build the Kubernetes manifests. 
This CR is optional for KOTS applications.

The full spec for the config cr is available in the [reference section](/reference/v1beta1/config/).
