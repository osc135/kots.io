The [Replicated Troubleshoot project](https://github.com/replicatedhq/troubleshoot) provides the Support Bundle diagnostic tool that KOTS integrates deeply with. 
By providing this custom resources, vendors can collect, redact, and analyze troubleshooting data from a cluster, to help diagnose problems with application deployments. 
The tool depends on two Custom Resources.

A [Collector Spec](https://troubleshoot.sh/reference/collectors/overview/) defines the data to be collected and included in the tar.gz bundle.

An [Analyzer Spec](https://troubleshoot.sh/reference/analyzers/overview/) defines how to interpret and present the collected data to the application operator.

Both support-bundle custom resources are optional for KOTS applications.

Support Bundle collection and analysis are integrated into the [Admin Console Dashboard](/kotsadm/troubleshooting/support-bundle/), and are also available through a [standalone kubectl plugin](https://troubleshoot.sh/docs/support-bundle/collecting/).
